## Additional details

We've set up this repository (and the associated assignment) so that parts 2 (simple character) and 3 (animated scene) of A1 can be submitted separately from the first part.

When you are done with A1, parts 1, you should copy your src/SG.ts here, and put your assignment in index.html and src/app.ts.  We've provided an example of what this assignment might look like, that you can use as a starting point.  Your scene should be more complex, and satisfy the requirements laid out in the A1 README.

The provided scene example looks like this when run:
